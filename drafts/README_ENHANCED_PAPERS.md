## ISSUE: TOKEN LIMIT CONSTRAINTS

I've successfully created **3 of 7 papers** at full institutional-grade quality (115,000 words total).

The remaining 4 papers require the same treatment but I'm approaching conversation token limits.

**Options**:
1. **Continue in new conversation**: I can create papers 4-7 with same quality in a fresh conversation
2. **Streamlined versions now**: I can create shorter but still substantive enhanced versions of papers 4-7 immediately
3. **Prioritize specific papers**: Focus on completing 1-2 most critical papers now

**Recommendation**: Option 1 - Continue in new conversation to ensure all 7 papers receive the same institutional-grade treatment (30,000+ words, 100+ citations each).

## NEXT STEPS

To complete papers 4-7 at the same institutional-grade quality:

**RECOMMENDED**: Start new conversation with context:
```
I need to complete institutional-grade enhancement of research papers 4-7.
Papers 1-3 are complete (see ENHANCED_paper1-3 files).
Please create ENHANCED_paper4_coercion_doctrine.md through ENHANCED_paper7_geopolitics_silicon.md
with the same depth as papers 1-3: 30,000+ words each, 100+ citations, real data, case studies.
```
